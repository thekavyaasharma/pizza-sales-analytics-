Hii, I'm Kavya Sharma, a second-year BTech CSE student, and this is my project: SQL-Driven Pizza Sales Analytics. The project explores pizza sales data to analyze orders, revenue, and customer preferences using SQL queries.

This project uses a structured database with four tables:
Pizza: Details about pizza types, categories, sizes, and prices.
Orders: Information on order IDs, dates, and times.
Order Details: Breakdown of pizzas ordered (quantities and types).
Pizza Type: Additional data like ingredients and pizza descriptions.

The analysis is divided into three levels:
-Basic
Total number of orders and revenue,
Highest-priced pizza and the most common pizza size,
Top 5 pizza types by quantity.

-Intermediate
Category-wise and hourly distribution of orders,
Average pizzas ordered per day,
Top 3 pizza types by revenue.

-Advanced
Percentage revenue contribution of each pizza type,
Cumulative revenue trends,
Top 3 pizzas by revenue for each category.

This project enhanced my sql skills, data analysis capabilities, and problem-solving abilities while providing insights into real-world datasets.
